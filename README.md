# Python Design Patterns

Welcome to the **Python Design Patterns** repository! This project serves as a collection of commonly used design patterns implemented in Python, helping developers solve recurring problems efficiently and elegantly.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide:
- A practical reference for **design patterns** in Python.
- Examples of **real-world applications** of patterns.
- Insight into the **advantages and limitations** of each pattern.

---

## 🗂️ Patterns Covered

### Creational Patterns
- **Singleton**: Ensures only one instance of a class is created.
- **Factory Method**: Delegates object instantiation to subclasses.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface to create families of related objects.
- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step.
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by cloning existing ones.

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter**: Bridges two incompatible interfaces.
- **Decorator**: Dynamically adds behavior to objects.
- **Proxy**: Controls access to an object.
- **Composite**: Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- **Bridge**: Separates abstraction from implementation.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer**: Defines a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects of state changes.
- **Strategy**: Encapsulates interchangeable behaviors and algorithms.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object.
- **State**: Manages object behavior based on its state.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method.
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes requests along a chain of handlers.
